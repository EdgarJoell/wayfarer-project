## Description of Project
This purpose of this project was to mimic an on-the-job scenario where we are given the wireframes for the application as well as the user-stories. Then our group is supposed to come together to produce a product that stays faithful to the wireframe and user-stories.

The project idea was to create almost a social media site for travelers. People can see posts in certain cities and read how those peoples experience was like when they traveled to that city.

## Approach 
The apporach to building this project was to follow the given wireframe through and through and add styling that we thought would best fit the application. Our group wanted to take the development approach of paired-programming in order to solve problems encountered when using Angular and to also write out the application with features that all of us were okay with.

## Challenges/Hurdles
One of our challenges happened early in the development process. In the wireframe there was a photo carousel that needed to be implemented on the Splash page adn we tried to hardcode the CSS but it was taking way too long so we chose to streamline the styling process so our group decided to use the famous CSS library called Bootstrap. Then our next challenge was to understand how to use Bootstrap to our advantage in order to make our project look great.

## Accomplishments
One of the major accomplishments with this project is that our group had a firm understand of Angular concepts such as routing, directives, and importing and exporting classes and modules. The topic of routing is pretty challenging and confusing to new learners but we were able to pick up on routing quick enough to the point where it would be a simple implementation for each new page/module created.
